In the days of old Japan, swords were both valuable and critical, and so no competent samurai would risk owning a sword that had not been thoroughly tested with a <i>tameshi-giri</i> (trial cut). 
These were sometimes completed by executioners, who utilised corpses or condemned prisoners, as was to hand. There were a wide variety of possible tests cuts, ranging from beheadings to more realistic battlefield cuts and even cuts through multiple prisoners bound together, and it is said that the bodies were repeatedly stacked 
and sliced until nothing remained larger than a fist. At the risk of inviting a reasonable criticism of poorly chosen focus, we might note that for the client the process was both expensive and risky, for the slightest damage to a blade would render it worthless.

There is a story told within Japanese sword circles that a prisoner was to be executed as part of such a testing, using a <i>kesa-giri</i> (downwards diagonal cut) from the victim's right shoulder through their ribcage and out of their abdomen: a cut known as the <i>okesa</i>, presumably because it drew one of the upper lines of an okesa wrap  &ndash; with some grim irony as prisoners were executed with little but a <i>fundoshi</i> loincloth for protection. As dawn broke, the prisoner was taken out by his warden and, with that generous spirit so common in those with absolute power, the warden told him of his fate. With a commendable calm, he turned to his executioner and said "If only I had known; I would have eaten a hearty meal of large stones for breakfast".

<span class=note>1</span>I forget where I first read this story, but Darrell Max Craig (1981) <span class=title>Iai: The Art of Drawing the Sword</span>. Tuttle, p.175 onwards, contains a good many of the grisly, and gristly, details of this practice.
