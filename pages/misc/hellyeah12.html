<h2 class=top>Hell Yeah: Héloïse</h2>

<div class=marginalia>
 The relationship was widely known about after the castration, 
and Abélard composed a number of popular songs and poems about it. 
The letters circulated in Latin, but became popular in translation from c.1285.

<p>
In 1116, Héloïse, one of the brightest students of Northern France, began a secret relationship with her teacher, the superstar scholar Pierre ("Peter") Abélard. When she became pregnant a year later, despite her general dismissal of the institution of marriage, she reluctantly wedded Abélard. 
Her guardian uncle agreed to the wedding, but afterwards gathered a mob of family together, snuck into Abélard's house, and castrated him. The bereft lovers agreed to enter the church, with Héloïse becoming a nun, but, again, 
reluctantly, and only to prove her dedication to Abélard. Eventually Abélard set up a convent which Héloïse led as abbess, and during this period they wrote a number of letters to each other. This quote comes from the first letter of Héloïse to Abélard; one might note that the letters were written with public circulation very much in mind<span class=note>2</span>.

Notes:
</p>
<p>
<span class=note>1</span>The general theme of this part of the letter from Héloïse is that marriage is tainted with a disingenuous self-interest, and she would rather degrade herself for Abélard, founded, as their 
relationship is, on a genuine conjunction of love and lust. One might note that a religious life wouldn't have been her first choice.
