<p>
<span class=note>1</span> Do I need to count the ways this is wrong? Well, just to let off steam, do let me:</p>
<p>a) Homosexuals are very unlikely to marry a person of the opposite sex just because they aren't allowed to marry a person of their sex.</p>
<p>b) Loving one person doesn't 'degrade' another.</p>
<p>c) Women and girls can be homosexual too; it's not 1900.</p>
<p>d) The respect with which women and girls are held is not predicated on their marriage; again, don't make me tap the calendar, but it's not 1900.</p>
<p>e) I doubt your sex is in difficulty because of this, but I also doubt your gender is; neither are binary.</p>
<p>f) I don't see heterosexuality diving off a cliff to become a minority position here, so what evidence is there you are in difficulty?</p>
<p>g) If you're not homosexual, it's none of your goddam business.</p>
<p>
I don't really know how someone can be so wrong in so few words.
