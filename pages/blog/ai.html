<h2 class=top>Lesson of Artificial Intelligence I: it's not AI we need to worry about</h2>
<div class=marginalia>

<p>
It seems a popular position, faced with the uncanniness of modern machine learning, to regard AI as a threat to the human race that needs stringent control. But we happily ignore that AI is in essence 
a meta-intelligence<span class=note>1</span>, founded on all humanity has produced that can be expressed. It isn't AI that we need to improve, but human interactions. 
AI simply refects its inputs.<span class=note>2,</span><span class=note>3</span>

Notes:
</p>
<p><span class=note>1</span> The potential for new knowledge to emerge from the mass is considerable, whereas I suspect the threats are old fashioned.  
</p>
<p><span class=note>2</span> It's also much more likely that the uses of AI will be damaging, than AI itself; the chances are vastly weighted in the favour of humans being the awful part of the process. 
</p>
<p><span class=note>3</span> I speak here as someone who has worked as an academic building AIs and Artificial Life for the last 20-odd years, and has also managed a significant chunk of a research ethics process, including 
teaching ethics. Lest anyone want credentials.
