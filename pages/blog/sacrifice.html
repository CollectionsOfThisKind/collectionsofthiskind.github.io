<h2 class=top>The Trolley Problem</h2>
<div class=marginalia>

</div>

<p>
It seems to me the solution to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem">The Trolley Problem</a><span class=note>1</span> is that the viewer should throw themselves under the wheels, in the hope of a derailment.
</p>
<p>
Dare I say it, the standard arguments<span class=note>2</span> don't seem to reflect well on our society<span class=note>3</span>.

Notes:
</p>
<p><span class=note>1</span><cite class=inline><span class=author>Foot, P.</span> <span class=date>(1967)</span> <span class=title>"<a href="http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ362/hallam/Readings/FootDoubleEffect.pdf">The Problem of Abortion and the Doctrine of the Double Effect.</a>"</span> <span class=location>Oxford Review, Number 5</span>.</cite>
</p>



<p><span class=note>2</span> The best summary on current thinking on the Trolley Problem is:<br />
<cite><span class=author>Bruers, S., Braeckman, J. </span> <span class=date>(2014)</span> <span class=title>"<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11406-013-9507-5">A Review and Systematization of the Trolley Problem.</a>"</span> <span class=location>Philosophia 42, 251â€“269</span> (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263681254_A_Review_and_Systematization_of_the_Trolley_Problem">ResearchGate</a>).</cite> 
</p>

<p><span class=note>3</span>The same goes for the discussions of Kierkegaard on Abraham, and of Judges 11:30-40. 
I note that Foot implies almost the same thing in her original paper, noting in a similar example: 
"...it would be reasonable to act, though one
would respect someone who held back from the appalling action either because he preferred to perish
rather than do such a thing..."; she just doesn't note it as a solution.
