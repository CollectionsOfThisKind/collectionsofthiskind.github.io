<h2 class=top>Letter to America</h2>

<div class=marginalia>

</div>

<p>

While Trump and the American Right are certainly to blame in a proximal sense for the current situation, the climate in America<span class=note>1</span> has been worsening for decades. 
In the 30 years I've been regularly going there, it's become more and more of a fascist-lite state, 
but like the frog in the proverbial pot few seem to have noticed the temperature being turned up (and, indeed, that they themselves have reached up out of the pot to turn it). 
</p>

<p>
It's not even that the government or religious groups have been driving the change; it has come from everyday Americans working 
through, like clockwork, on the fundamental axioms they've eased into the foundations of their society. Even within academia, generally the most left-wing community worldwide, while there 
are a good many folk on the left, there are a surprising number of American academics that won't question those foundations and the logical consequences 
that are likely to play out from them<span class=note>2</span>. 
</p>
<p>
These foundations clearly go back to the American revolution, and earlier<span class=note>3</span>. The liberal republican intelligentsia of Europe spent so much time 
lauding America in the late 18th and early 19th century, that the Americans came to believe they really were the home of the free 
and could therefore do no wrong &ndash; something that doubtless appealed to the thin threads of residual religious self-righteousness they inherited from the Puritan founders, and  
the independence of the more general Colonial Migration influx. 
This, in turn, seems to have led to a self-satisfied and unreflective national psyche that laid the groundwork for where we are now. It is, as far as 
I can see, a society founded on the following resultant traits<span class=note>4</span>:
</p>
<p>
<ul class=inpage>
<li>- An internalised, axiomatic, fundamentalist belief they can do no wrong and no one should impose rules upon them; confusing the freedom from imposition for the largely incompatible freedom to exist.</li>

<li>- A resultant general distrust of the influence of others, including other states, which has enhanced heterogeneity,  
and, paradoxically, enhanced an over-exaggerated respect for the office of the ultimate individual, the president, rather than recognising the responsibilities of the broader government as we see in most Western democracies. 
Ironically, the president has more power than a king would, as the latter continually fears revolution.</li>

<li>- A resultant distancing of the population from the complexities of the rest of the world, which combines with their belief in individualism to produce a performative over-respect for those risking their 
lives serving their nation elsewhere<span class=note>5</span>. The embodiment of the armed services as the vessel of a nationhood ("U.S.A.! U.S.A.!") brooks no space to think through alternatives and predisposes them to a militarism backed by a willingness to 
invest in the military which only encourages, and turns to practice, their exceptionalism. </li>

<li>- A powerful church-based social structure that has changed little since the 18th C, when it capitalised on rural isolation to quietly squash any real individualism and prevent 
the rise of atheism seen in much of the rest of the, more urban, West<span class=note>6</span>.  </li>

<li>- An natural wealth largely untapped until after the Industrial Revolution, that has allowed a growth in the mindset that money is power. Along with the slow growth of a implicit belief in prosperity theology since the 19th C, 
this has encouraged the resultant belief that America should be allowed 
to dictate to the rest of the world how it acts &ndash; which is largely in line with American religious sensibilities and capitalist needs.</li>

<li>- A mistaken belief that national exceptionalism combined with a freedom to succeed implies a personal exceptionalism, which then encourages that worst and most easily induced of human foibles: the belief that, relative to ourselves, 
the richer are a community open to anyone and the poorer (and different) are to blame for us not getting there.</li> 

<li>- All of which has led to a Calvinistic approach to social and medical safety nets, which seem resisted to a point way beyond any sane civilization and any self-interest voters might have.</li>

</ul>
</p>
<p>
This is all very different from Europe, where we've had the same fundamental culture, but in a wide variety of nuanced forms, for 700 years, and have had the time to realise we're not perfect, 
even if we thought we were. It's also the case that segregation of government and language across the continent has offered a certain degree of 
protection from the times we've failed to realise that<span class=note>7,8</span>. Wherever a community has been temporarily convinced of its exceptionalism (NAZI Germany; Early 90s Serbia) it's rapidly been beaten out 
of them by neighbouring countries when they tried to prove it; America 
has neither had the time nor the powerful neighbours to mature; the only reason it has got away with it outside its borders for so long is that America's desires have generally (with some notable exceptions) aligned with those they've 
imposed on, and 
we've allowed them to have their way to our mutual advantage. 
</p>
<p>
The current situation in America can't persist; the money and the driving forces (I hate to use the word 'philosophy') are different. As we've seen, they can't be both Dark Enlightenment Tech Bros running EV factories 
and Right Wing Christian Technophobic Climate Deniers<span class=note>9</span>, but other cracks will open because they've powered a government on hate and self-interest as the common denominator of too many groups with contradictory desires; there's no tolerance in hate. 
Our one hope has to be they destroy each other before they destroy us.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps this is the mental purge American needs, but I doubt it. I really hope AOC and Bernie start a fundamental rethink of the American psyche, but I think the 
general lack of self-understanding is fundamentally entrenched. Like all extreme popularists, Trump's promise is the id run wild, but he didn't invent that id.
Most American liberals would probably object to the above description, or regard it with pride, and that's 
entirely the problem<span class=note>10</span>. Sadly I'm 99% certain America will come out of this period and reset to standard Republicanism<span class=note>11</span>, not the braver new world and beacon for excellence they could become.

Notes:
</p>
<p>
<span class=note>1</span> By which, with apologies, I mean the non-First Nation USA.   
</p>

<p>
<span class=note>2</span> I remember in 2012, addressing an international conference in New York on the subject of ethics and asking, after a couple of weeks of 
travelling the US, and with all the worked-up parental anger of an old-worlder, whether they were hanging socialists from lampposts yet. I was taken 
aside at the end and told I couldn't joke about such things in America; which rather played to my point. 
</p>

<p>
<span class=note>3</span> And here I don't say anything much that didn't appear to De Tocqueville, but who is as guilty as anyone.  
</p>

<p>
<span class=note>4</span> It seems to me, these unfold from American early history like the adult personality of a spoilt only-child. 
</p>

<p>
<span class=note>5</span> While a degree of respect for those willing to sacrifice their lives to protect those interests of universal benefit and who engage in sound conduct 
is fully supportable, the respect for American military seems founded on the principle that they are universally unblameworthy because they embody the infallibility of the United States, 
and an unacknowledged truth that overheated praise will keep the recruitment lines fed. A friend of mine once went to an aquarium park, where for no good reason to do with captive fish 
the crowd at a show were asked to show their support for their troops, and started screaming U! S! A! U! S! A! in the most hysterical fashion. It seems likely one has only to experience such a thing to 
realise it's a society with Sparta-level militarism.
</p>

<p>
<span class=note>6</span> In this sense it is replaced in Europe and the UK specifically, by the controlling notion of "honour" and the "gentleman", which was meant to hold in thrall isolated communities across the British and 
German empires during the same time period, with much the same success and failure rates. 
</p>

<p>
<span class=note>7</span> Which is exactly why the media barons hate Europe and wanted Brexit &ndash; it's very hard for them to spread controlling lies across a continent of different languages.
</p>

<p>
<span class=note>8</span> Though, actually, I think we're more than mature and diverse enough for a European superstate.
</p>

<p>
<span class=note>9</span> The only thing they have in common is the desire to deny women control over their own bodies. In this respect Trump's government is like the Iranian Revolution: the Communists and Islamic Fundamentalists were entirely incompatible; one had to go. The Tech Bros have all the power and probably less 
of the skeletons, but the Christian nut cases have Dunning-Kruger popularism and the lever of God, and that seems to be winning out, but for how long without the income? 
</p>

<p>
<span class=note>10</span> Which, despite the rise of the democrats as the demographically predestined party, is where American politics in practice resides when compared with the rest of the West.
</p>

<p>
<span class=note>11</span> I can just hear some of my American colleagues saying "What, we're not humble enough for you?? We're too *great*??".
