<h2 class=top>The Lesson of Artificial Intelligence II</h2>

<p>
I really hope that what AI drives us towards is a concentration on the human experience 
and what truly makes us happy<span class=note>1</span>. The ideal response to AI shouldn't be anxiety, but a new, positive, existentialism<span class=note>2</span>.

Notes:
</p>
<p><span class=note>1</span> I appreciate many people worry about their jobs, and that's a 
legitimate worry, but here's hoping that switch to concentrating on the human experience is 
just in time to convince people 
to adjust the economy to Fully Automated Luxury Communism; the alternative, without that 
driving us, is bound to be unpleasant. 
</p>
<p><span class=note>2</span> One might point to Japan as the maelstrom of these themes, where 
technological capitalism and a focus on aesthetic experience seem to dance hand-in-hand round in the vortex  (though I think Westerners sometimes make more of that than the Japanese spend time thinking about, 
the elements are there).
