<h2 class=top>The Lesson of Artificial Intelligence I</h2>
<div class=marginalia>

</div>

<p>
The sad truth is I talk to AI alot at work, not because it is right in answering queries<span class=note>1</span>, but because its responses are nicer than many of my colleagues'. One lesson of AI is apparently that if 
you don't want to be replaced in 
human interactions, you need to be inspired by it to work towards being a better quality 
character than a machine can muster<span class=note>2,3</span>.

Notes:
</p>
<p><span class=note>1</span> And the solutions AI gives me are quite often not great; maybe this is 
the start of some new idiocracy, almost the opposite of the popularist right, where people  accept 
anything just because AI is nicer to interact with than other people.
</p>
<p><span class=note>2</span> Which doesn't necessarily mean nicer or more knowledgeable; it could be 
more interesting, for example.

<p><span class=note>3</span> And see <a href="ai3.html">Part II</a> on replacement.
