<h2 class=top>The Lesson of Artificial Intelligence I</h2>

<p>
The reason I talk to AI alot at work is not because it is right<span class=note>1</span>, but because it's  
nicer than many of my colleagues. The lesson of AI is that if you don't want to be obsolete, 
you need people to want to interact with you.

the start of some new idiocracy, almost the opposite of the popularist right, where people just accept 
anything because AI is nicer to interact with than other people.
