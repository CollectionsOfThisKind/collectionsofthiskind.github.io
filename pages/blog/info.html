I find these days, I swim more and more in an oneiric information fantasy. Whereas previously information informed our world, it now structures it, but on the basis of an ever-wandering walk of connections, a hallucination of an investigation, 
a vacuuming of our lives into the endlessly recursive vicarious from which 
only the lucid dreamer and surrealist can pull use.

<p>
Action, and the aesthetic appreciation of 
lived moments, seem like the only escape from this opiate 
miasma.<span class=note>1</span>
