Partner's friend: Oo, no tea for me... the caffeine is a bit too much. Do you have anything herbal?

Me: yeah, I know exactly what you mean. I once went into a club toilet with a couple of recently made acquaintances, and we were entirely distracted to find a heap of random powder sat on the cistern, so we each did a line, and, you know what, it turned out that was a bit too much. So, I know exactly where you're coming from... chamomile?
