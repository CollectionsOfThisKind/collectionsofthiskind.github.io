<h2 class=top>On difference</h2>
<div class=marginalia>

</div>

<p>A few years ago the BBC did a joint project 
with an academic, in which they put online a lengthy survey, the aim of which 
was to identify if you were a psychopath. My friends all joked about it on Facebook, revealing and revelling that they were "20% psycho", or "30% psycho" like that was 
the proudest moment of their lives, so high their scores. I scored 87%, and stayed quiet<span class=note>1</span>.  
</p>
<p>
And yet, I had the good fortune to grow up in a loving home surrounded by a strong 
sense of ethics. I remember clearly an instance of this: at my 8th birthday party (the one and only birthday party I had, possibly because of what happened), an unreasonably popular kid came along, 
took my new bike<span class=note>2</span>, and refused to give it back; riding it around and around our garden. I rewarded them for this by sticking 
my brother's lightsabre into the spokes of the front wheel, with the distinct calculation that they'd go over the front and stop, injuries be damned; a prediction 
which panned out perfectly. Fortunately for the world, my parents taught me this was not at all a reasonable way to behave, and I didn't do it again<span class=note>3</span>. 
</p>
<p>
And yet, I didn't generalize this experience to not sticking a plastic lightsabre in the rest of life. Psychopath tests notoriously highlight a range of 
personality traits, only some of which (not least criminality) strongly indicate psychopathology. If you asked people who know of me, they'd say I was the furthest 
thing from a psychopath. I help organise community groups, I'm supportive of young people, I'm genuinely caring, at least at a societal level, and value social and 
environmental justice. Nevertheless, in terms of a general lack of sympathy for social norms, 
I'd probably still, objectively, score higher than would be generally acceptable;   
I'll quite happily push situations way beyond the limits of society &ndash; which for someone who has always suffered from chronic anxiety, seems unhelpful. 
The truth is, I frequently fail to recognise what others consider normal<span class=note>4</span>. 
</p>
<p>
I have always felt somewhat out of kilter with the world. I assumed everyone felt like that, but I've learnt two hard lessons 
in life: the first is when people say they're different, they rarely actually are. The second is that the chief way you can tell you're genuinely different is 
that, with some rare exceptions, if you expose your difference to the world, society will utterly destroy you. I see a lot of nonsense online about 
"celebrating your weirdness" or "being proud of your quirks", well, I'm here to tell you that if you're genuinely different, likelihood is the kinds of people that say 
that stuff will be in the queue to burn you at the stake just like everyone else.
</p>
<p>
My advice, built on hard experience, is this: titrate your difference to the people who will stick small measures at 
first, and build up their love over decades; they'll be the only ones not carrying fire.

Notes:
</p>
<p>
<span class=note>1</span> Funnily enough, the only other person I know who came close was a female friend, also from Sussex, who 
got 67%. Maybe its a southern thing. 
</p>
<p>
<span class=note>2</span> The bike was a Raleigh Grifter, surely the greatest bike ever made. At the time, all the cool kids had 
Raleigh Choppers, but anyone who understood actual quality and utility had a Grifter. 
Choppers looked great but were basically horrible to use and impractical. 
Grifters were everything a rural kid could want: being the prototype of BMXs, but built like a Challenger tank. They had big wheels that actually 
worked on rough ground, good grippy handles, easy-twist gears, a really well cushioned seat and (amazing when you went over them) cushioned handlebars, 
along with great mudguards and a rock solid thick steel frame. I used to regularly throw 
mine off seawalls to no effect. My friends over the road had Choppers, and they rode them once. I knew a Grifter would take a stick in the wheel.
</p>
<p>
<span class=note>3</span> I must have learnt something, because when I was nine I remembering trying to strangle my baby brother into silence 
and realising that maybe this wasn't appropriate before it actually worked. 
</p>
<p>
<span class=note>4</span> This isn't just me saying this: recently, when asked what "eccentric" meant by our 
youngest, my partner just pointed at me &ndash; which I was genuinely surprised by, as I don't feel eccentric at all.
