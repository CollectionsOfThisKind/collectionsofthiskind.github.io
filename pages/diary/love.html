<h2 class=top>On love</h2>
<div class=marginalia>
On listening to 'Young Folks', by Peter Bjorn and John.
</div>

<p>
There is a space of pure joy, in which two equally exciting and interesting human beings meet, fall in love, adventure. When you think, 'life will never be boring, nor unpleasant with 
this person'. The cooling breeze blows across the park on a summer's morning; you met at a cool little coffee shop, where they know your orders, and you found you are going to the 
same apartment for a party that evening, where you'll chat and find a mutual interest in drawing comic books, boyish haircuts, and subverting computer security. You're both ready to run pell-mell into life. Young, confident, creating in your own way; encouraging each other to greater projects.
</p>
<p>
That must be nice. But I realise now, as perhaps I always have, that this is not for me &ndash; for my <i>type</i>  &ndash;  for as soon as I am intimate with anyone, they become a 
burden, crushing the life out of me with their, even minor, requests. I have never needed anyone, nor felt the need to ask anything of anyone. I have known some emotional vampires in my time: people 
who only live by sucking someone else vicariously into their empty shell<span class=note>1</span>. It is beyond me. But even the most basic levels of a relationship seem problematic to me. 
</p>
<p>
I have had only two relationships (including my current) where my partner was so independent as to never feel like a burden. I appreciate this will be an anathema to 
those who love fiercely; who can only feel a deep sorrow to hear it, but, sweet gods, what freedom.

Notes:
</p>
<p><span class=note>1</span> As the great Bill Burroughs once said: "If, after having been exposed to someone's presence, you feel as if you've lost a quart of plasma: 
avoid that presence. You need it like you need pernicious anemia." (Words of Advice for Young People, with Bill Laswell; 1993).
