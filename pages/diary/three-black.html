Reading 'The Black Mountain Poems'<br />
Tucked in bed, <br />
while my cat listens carefully to Mica Levi.

Notes:
</p>
<p><span class=note>1</span> I can't tell you how much I love this album, "The Miraculous Mandarin" meets "Close Encounters".  
</p>
<p><span class=note>2</span> And so...<br />
My cat, curled by my head. Juxtaposed with the toothpick which she tries to eat.<br /> 
The book, looming over her head, like the old testament god.<br />
The book, the cat, the toothpick, in a crazed space defined by curves and lines but in which it resides as some kind of triangle.<br />
The ears turn, tracing arcs in the space.<br />
My coffee cup interjects, traversing a curve from shelf to bed. <br />
The paws move forward, they move back. The toothpick is covered, uncovered.<br />
In some way, this geometry carves out a permanent object in an hypercomplex space-time, and only I to witness it.<br /> 
In some way, this is perfectly normal.
