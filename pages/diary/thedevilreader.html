<h2 class=top>The Devil, Reader</h2>

<div class=marginalia>
You'd imagine it would be on the penultimate page, but he's far too charming for that...

There is, surely, only one book in Heaven<span class=note>1,</span>; I therefore take it The Devil is the reader, and choose to believe he's unlikely to 
snatch a fellow bibliophile while embedded in a book. Given this, I scoot, 23 skidoo, from the end of one book to the start of another, be it only the first line, before he can pop up and drag me to that hell where all the world's lost literature resides, but stuck beyond adamantine bars.

<span class=note>1</span> As it happens, I'm a great fan of Bronze-to-Iron Age Transition literature, but it's not all I want to read for eternity.
