for sanctuary from humanity<span class=note>1</span>.

Is this the threshold 
between the young and the old; that the old retreat from the world while the young advance towards it?

As it seems unlikely authors are the best people in the world (though I'm sure many are very fine, perhaps even the majority), and books are widely
