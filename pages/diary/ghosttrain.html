When I was a child, and knew not how formative youthful experiences were, my parents took me to Barry Island, where I insisted upon going on a ride called "Frankenstein's Ghost Train"<span class=note>1</span> 
with my dad. 
The car kicked the doors 
open; I shut my eyes;  and I kept them shut all the way through and out the other side. All I noticed was a squirt of 
water and some string on my face. I was so gutted at my cowardice I begged and begged to go on again. They refused. 
</p>
<p>
I've kept my eyes open ever since.

Notes:
</p>
<p>
<span class=note>1</span> There's a surprising amount on this ride online. Another classic there was The Gold Mine, a Western themed mine-ride, which I did keep my eyes open for, and seemed to me 
an adventure into another time and place.
</p>
<p>
<span class=note>2</span> I can't tell you how this experience made me. I have never since resisted jumping in with both feet where others might hold back. It has made me simultaneously 
uncomfortably gauche and exotically experienced.
