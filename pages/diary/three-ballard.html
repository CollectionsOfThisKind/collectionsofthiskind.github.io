Notes:
</p>
<p>
<span class=note>1</span> Not a single person queried it, or asked what I was reading, or why. I mention it not because I had any great interest in being talked to, but just because it says more than you might suspect about how crazed the social dynamics are in clubs.
</p>
<p>
<span class=note>2</span> I might add this isn't my first read in a club; I once sat for a whole evening reading 'Sperm Competition in Humans: Classic and Contemporary Readings' in a sex club 
on Kentish Town Road. No one saw the fun in that, either.
