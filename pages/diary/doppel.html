As we drove home from my primary school one day in 1979, I saw my older self walking up the road in the opposite direction.<span class=note>1</span> They didn't see me, so I've no way to tell when it was.

My parents, coming to visit, saw me in a service station on the M6; I looked straight through them, and though they followed me and called my name, I refused to acknowledge them. 
I was 50 miles away, at home.

I once attended (and participated in) the Abbots Bromley Horn Dance. I thought I was pretty clever in my choice of T-shirt, which had horns on it, and looking round, 
no one else had one. Someone sent me a photo of me dancing with the horns, only I wasn't in the photo, and looking directly into the camera from the far side of 
the dance was someone else, dressed exactly like me, but with a different face.
