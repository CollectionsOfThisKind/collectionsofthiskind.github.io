<h2 class=top>Kink and the Kyriarchy</h2>

<p>
I once knew a couple who lived together, slept in the same bed, but denied being involved, indeed, argued like cat and dog. They were quite clearly frustrated as hell. They kept the scion of a major Asian royal family at 
the foot of their bed; let her sleep on the floor there, provided she did the all the hoovering in their two-up-two-down terrace. All three of them had their own separate houses.

Notes:
</p>
<p>
<span class=note>1</span> It seems to me that, by removing all the sex, this was the purest kind of kink relationship: no one could accuse any of them of getting anything out of it but their own subjugation while simultaneously holding each other in utter thrall.
