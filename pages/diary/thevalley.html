<h2 class=top>The New Valley</h2>



<p>
Riding down our dale last week, cloud low over the turning woods and the churches golden with candlelight, I noticed a new valley had appeared, shallow and primordial, high on a mountainside and stretching into the mist. Not previously unseen, but instead newly added to reality as by the working of some giant and stately engine beneath the landscape. I've lived here these 30 years past, yet in the last year this has happened to me twice, and I wonder if these shifts are quietly common, and I have simply passed some threshold needed to notice this solemn magic.
