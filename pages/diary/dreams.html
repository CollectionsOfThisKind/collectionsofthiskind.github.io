<i>Dream Event 1</i>: I close my eyes and from the darkness a paler patch arises. It squares off into a corner. The corner is the edge of a door. I am in a room. Shades of grey. From patch to corner to door to room. I am in a room. I am waiting. 
For what? So things start.

<p>
<i>Dream Event 2</i>: I am awake and my eyes open, and the room is identical to that I would see. But it is not the room. I am facing the wrong way.<span class=note>1</span>
</p>
<p>
<i>Dream Event 3</i>: I am asleep in the dark. I am awake with eyes closed. All the difference is a slight lightening, like a layer of thick felt being removed. I am not awake.

Notes:
</p>
<p>
<span class=note>1</span> I should say, this was during the first 100 days of breakdown I had, when I went through 
periods of drifting between waking screaming and crashed-out post-panic sleep; but at one point I reached 
a halfway house of recurring open-eyed hallucinations of infinite white walls, holes in the ground, bramble twigs, and 
a room that was an exact and visually indistinguishable replica of my bedroom.
