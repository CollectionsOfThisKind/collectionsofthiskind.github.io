<h2 class=top>Blood on blood on blood</h2>

<div class=marginalia>
True horror.
</div>

<p>
Waking upon that supranatural instinct that something is wrong, and going downstairs to the kitchen to find my child, hunched on the floor, crimson rivulets from every surface of 
arms, legs, face, torso, crying with the terror of what they've wrought on themselves. 
</p>
<p>
What is there to be done, but hold them close, love them, and pick your way through the wounds.
