<p>
The old lady with Alzheimer's over the road has died. She lived her whole life in the village; never anything less than quietly lovely for all the years I've known her. As soon as she went, it started to snow. Just over our little village initially, and then slowly spreading along the valley and over the hills into the neighbouring vales. It's like she'd held on to the world as a waking dream, and now it can't do anything without her but close down and disappear finally into the greying night.
