<h2 class=top>On Snow</h2>

<p>
Snow exceeds all other weather in my estimation<span class=note>1</span>. It comes with no expectations or undertakings; it asks nothing, expects nothing. Whether in close unbreathable blizzard on a hillside at the height of the day, or deep in the woods at night, you can live; you can die; it cares not<span class=note>2</span>. There is nothing but the soft silent fall and the pure unspoken ringing of bells across an unseelie landscape.

Notes:

<p>
<span class=note>1</span> It is where I feel most at home, most myself, stripped of all that is extraneous. It is the zazen of weather conditions.
</p>
