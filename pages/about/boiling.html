Boiling: churning, upwelling, bursting.

<p class="left">
In linear narratives the past is written and fixed. These encourage a sequential worldview where self development and memory are arbitrated and filtered by a progressive and unrepentantly current window of experiences<span class=note>1</span>.</p> 

<p class="left">
A more useful chronology would revisit the past as a mass, with a timeless overview of what is useful<span class=note>2</span> &ndash; revisiting the under-developed and forgiving those elements of potential.

Notes:
</p>
<p>
<span class=note>1</span> People are more Markovian than we generally acknowledge.
</p>
<p>
<span class=note>2</span> This is somewhat in debt to 
<cite class=inline><span class=author>Boethius'</span> <span class=title>"Consolations"</span></cite>, where the nearer to his god one gets, the wider the scoop of "now" becomes, until we finally reach a black hole deity who views the whole of time as one. But Boethius' deity is right, now and forever; "boiling" chronologies have a meta-timeline, where they revisit and revise. Ironically, in death Boethius took the opposite route: fracturing into multiple timelines where he was varingly clubbed to death, had his head crushed by ropes until his eyes popped out, was strangled, or beheaded with a sword. Full strength to him for imagining that his god saw such fancies eternally, and was pleased.
