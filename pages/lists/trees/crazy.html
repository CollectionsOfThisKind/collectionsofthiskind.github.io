</td>

<td class=info rowspan=12>

The trope of a crowd uncontrollably at the whim of their most base instincts<span class=note>1</span> is a relatively modern one, although 
we might draw a line from the Divine Marquis and <i>Les 120 Journées de Sodome</i>. The 
earliest example I can find is Charles Platt's "The Gas" (1970), in which a leak from a British military bio-research lab 
causes the people of Southern England to deteriorate into lust and carnage. Although Romero stated that "<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069895/">The Crazies</a>" (1973) 
was based on a script "The Mad People" by Paul McCollough about a bioweapon plane crashing<span class=note>2</span>, there are clear similarities, 
as there are in 1984's "<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087464/">Impulse</a>" &ndash; one of the 
lesser known but better examples of the genre, in which a village has its milk supply tainted.  
<br><br>
Perhaps the most brutal example is the long running comic series "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossed_(comics)">Crossed</a>"<span class=note>3</span>, which combines this with the running zombie trope with little relief <span class=edit id='20230422'>(in turn an influence on the non-Zombie 2021 virus film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13872248/">The Sadness</a>)</span>. 
Conversely, perhaps the most interesting and intelligent treatment is that by Grant Morrison in two 1990 issues of the D.C. comic "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellblazer">Hellblazer</a>" 
("#25: Early Warning" / "#26: How I Learned to Love the Bomb") in which 
an English village revisits the themes of rural festival, apparently under the control of a nearby military base.
<br><br>
For earlier influences we might look to three real world events made famous in the 1950s and 60s:  
the chaos in the 17<sup>th</sup>&#7428 Ursuline convent of Loudun made famous by Aldous Huxley's extraordinary  
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devils_of_Loudun">The Devils of Loudun"</a> (1952) 
(see also the film "<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066993/">The Devils</a>", 1971); the unusual events in the French village of Pont-Saint-Esprit in 1951, 
as outlined in  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_G._Fuller">John Fuller's</a> much maligned 1968 study "The Day of St Anthony's Fire", which proposed the 
case was one of mass ergot poisoning; and the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minamata_disease">Minamata disaster</a> of 1956. However, 
there is no evidence these directly influenced Platt as far as I know.

Notes:
</p>
<p>
<span class=note>1</span>Here we exclude similar themes where control is exerted on a population from outside to perform violence, whereof we 
might include 
<cite class=inline><span class=author>Lovecraft's</span> <span class=date>(1927)</span> <span class=title>"Color out of Space"</span></cite>; 
<cite class=inline><span class=author>Wyndham's</span> <span class=date>(1957)</span> <span class=title>"The Midwich Cuckoos"</span></cite>;
<cite class=inline><span class=author>Kneale's</span> <span class=date>(1958)</span> <span class=title>"Quatermass and the Pit"</span></cite>; 
<cite class=inline><span class=author>"Guy Leopold"'s</span> <span class=date>(1971)</span> <span class=title>"Dr Who and the Dæmons"</span></cite>; and
<cite class=inline><span class=author>King's</span> <span class=date>(1987)</span> <span class=title>"The Tommyknockers"</span></cite>, to name but a sample. 
Nor do we include books of religious insanity such as 
<cite class=inline><span class=author>Hughes'</span> <span class=date>(1977)</span> <span class=title>"Gaudete"</span></cite>, or the pacification of a population <i>à la</i> 
<cite class=inline><span class=author>Levin's</span> <span class=date>(1972)</span> <span class=title>"The Stepford Wives"</span></cite> or 
<cite class=inline><span class=author>Burnham and Ray's</span> <span class=date>(1976)</span> <span class=title>"Children of the Stones"</span></cite>. 
We also exclude crowds where a moral code has been willfully abandoned, such as <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6205872/">Assassination Nation</a> or the 
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2184339/">Purge</a> series.

<span class=note>3</span>
Crossed is very specifically balanced between the two tropes by including a good deal of lust. 
The running zombie trope is a more likely origin for modern films focused purely on irrational violence,  
such as <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0775440/">Cell</a>.
