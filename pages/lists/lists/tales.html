A list of Ladybirds. See notes for comments on variations.

<p>
Undoubtably one of the most important but neglected set of folklore books ever, the 'Well Loved Tales' series by 
Wills &amp; Hepworth's Ladybird imprint<span class=note>1</span> sold over 80 million copies and were translated into 
25 languages<span class=note>2</span>. The first 27 tales were largely folktales retold by teacher, educationalist, and sociologist Vera Southgate<span class=note>3</span>. 
These were followed by some 20 other books by various authors, including a number of simplifications of works by well known writers. 
The list below gives, respectively, their publication date, reading grade, reworking author, and first known illustrator<span class=note>4</span>. The first 25 books were numbered as below<span class=note>5</span>. 
Italicized books are those consulted directly in this edition<span class=note>6</span>.

The series is equally well known for its variations over the years. From the start, there was, even from individual artists, a good deal 
of experimentation. Nevertheless, the series generally worked to a high level of realism, with a great deal of well drawn animal life and 
detailing in both the rural and urban scenes, as well as a number of quite scary, dark, and grisly storylines. 
As the Southgate era came to an end, however, this general style came under attack from 
drivers to modernise the series and bring it into line with what adults felt to be appropriate and attractive for children. 
The first evidence of this was in the spine titles, which, in line with other Ladybird books, moved from the serif allcaps of the 1960s to 
more humanist titlecase sans-serif after the last Southgate book in 1974. 
</p>
<p>
The books were then restyled in 1979 with the addition of a yellow primrose-strewn header and a more experimental range of illustration styles. This 
also initiated a reworking of the older books, and in the mid-1980s some (e.g. "Bremen") were redrawn 
by new artists, with others retaining prior illustrations (e.g. "Sly Fox"), presumably because they matched the new style guide. And thus Ladybird transitioned into  
a period of fairly continual adjustment, with books redrawn multiple times, and in some cases illustrations from as late as the 1980s reworked directly to simplify them.
</p>
<p>
In contrast to the realism of the earlier books, the overall style became ever simpler and shifted the tales away from a setting that 
might be described as the pan-European post-Medieval and into more modern, if generic, settings. This ended with what could, unfairly 
(on Disney and the series) be described as the Disneyfication of the books. Many of them lost all their original character, and shifted to a generic 
"child-friendly" flat-colour cartoon style that was widely disliked by parents brought up on the orginals, and instantly forgetable to children. Nevertheless, it 
is worth pointing out that this wasn't an entirely new trend (Lumley experimented with a cartoon style in "Three Pigs" and to an extent in "Porridge Pot" and "Seven Kids"), 
and there were still a number of excellent illustrators who made efforts to reference the detailed nature illustration of the originals (Brian Price Thomas 
and Petula Stone leap to mind). It should also be said that the quality of illustration for a given style was generally higher and more 
consistent than some of the transition period work. Most notably, the later work includes illustrations by Ladybird "Golden Age" illustrator 
Martin Aitchison on "Firebird" as well as a number of other revisions. At the same time as the pictures were reworked, a number of the stories were re-written and the 
47 original books were cut down to 33, losing some of the less coherent and more folkloric storylines like "Rose Red" along with some of the 
more traumatic stories like the "Seven Kids". 
Both trends continued through the 1990s, which also saw the use of a red-with-black-spots theme for the books; a nice but ultimately ill-associated attempt to 
pick up on the Ladybird name that became synonymous with the creeping cartooning of the illustrations. 
</p>
<p>
These efforts were clearly unpopular, as Ladybird not only switched back to a 
more realistic and detailed style for the whole series in the mid-2000s, but reinstated Southgate as the author ("based on the original") and 
as good as apologised for their error by noting the new books contained "beautiful pictures of the kind children like best &ndash; full of richness and detail". 
While the new illustrations vary in some way more than the originals, and they are more stylised than the early realism, they are nevertheless very well 
illustrated, and many are exceptional. The 24 remaining books have come a long way round to their home again, but it is nice to see them once more providing a 
complex and emotional view of the world to interest and develop children.

<span class=note>5</span> Reading grades work up from Grade 1. The books generally aimed at ~51 pages but the starting numbering is erratic. They were printed with one of four colour bindings (red, yellow, blue, and green), providing a wide range of colour preferences. 
</p>

<p>
<span class=note>6</span> It is nice to note that Ladybird books have consistently remained in the range of pocketmoney, the latest series being issued at £1.99, almost exactly   
equivalent to the 15p cost in the 1970s, and the half crown cost in the 1960s (Bank of England inflation calculator).
</p>


<p>
<span class=note>7</span> Not to be confused with the 777 Series "Read It Yourself" which covered some of the same stories.
