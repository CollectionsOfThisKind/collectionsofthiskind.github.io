<p><i>Homo erectus</i> did the heavy lifting: they had communal hunting; cared for the disabled; controlled fire; cooked; had toolmaking traditions; had shelters with stone foundations; probably used language; possibly used clothing and boats<span class=note>2</span>.</p>
<p>The Flores population ("hobbits") may have been residual <i>H. erectus</i> or <i>H. habilis</i>, arriving c.1ma B.P. They likely lasted until 12ka B.P. overlapping with modern humans. Local folklore includes legends of small humanoids possibly indicating later survival<span class=note>3</span>. Tall individuals with 
<i>H. erectus</i> features may have survived until 9ka in Australia<span class=note>4</span>.</p>
<p>50k years ago, Neanderthals used deer ribs to smooth leather; we may have learnt it from them and the same tool is still used today<span class=note>5</span>. They may also have passed on cave painting<span class=note>5</span>.</p>
<p>We have been including grave goods in graves since at least 80&ndash;120ka B.P.<span class=note>6</span></p>
<p>The earliest human jewelry dates to at least 80&ndash;120ka B.P.<span class=note>6</span></p>
<p>Totem Poles probably pre-date the move to America and the earliest known is from 11ka B.P.; folk tales about the Raven may date from the same period.<span class=note>7</span>.</p>
