The intersection between books and decaying churches is exactly where I live, obviously.

<h2>The High Notes</h2>
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Comme-des-Garcons/Comme-des-Garcons-Series-3-Incense-Avignon-1230.html" target="_new">Incense: Avignon</a>, by Comme des Gar&ccedil;ons</dt><dd>Probably my favourite scent. Smells of High Church on an empty Monday afternoon<span class=note>2</span>.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/The-Perfumer-s-Story-by-Azzi/Old-Books-40015.html" target="_new">Old Books</a>, from The Perfumer's Story by Azzi</dt><dd>Less of books, more of an old stone church, part plastered, with damp Mediaeval wall paintings.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://www.fragrantica.uk/parfum/Etat-Libre-d-Orange/Noel-au-Balcon-2195.html" target="_new">Noel au Balcon</a>, by Etat Libre D'Orange</dt><dd>Like a church Christmas fÃªte, winter fruit and lilies with an undertone of church stone<span class=note>3</span>.</dd>

<h2>Also tried</h2>
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Etat-Libre-d-Orange/Archives-69-11411.html" target="_new">Archives 69</a>, by Etat Libre D'Orange</dt><dd>A note of church stone, but also of paper &ndash; but modern paper rather than second hand books. The smell of a well kept store of mobile shelving, with maybe a touch of orange.</dd>
<dt>Old Books Scent, by The Book-Nerd</dt><dd>After a pleasant but not terribly bookish start of yuzu and grass, rapidly settles to something more leathery. Would complement a good smelling book well, rather than matching it.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Byredo/Bibliotheque-43324.html" target="_new">Biblioth&egrave;que</a>, by Byredo</dt><dd>Swedish libraries must be a good deal sweeter than the ones I know. This starts very candied, but rapidly drops to plummy notes, though does carry a hint of leather chair. Just a hint.</dd>

<dt>The Old Bookstore, by AURORACandleStore<span class=note>4</span></dt><dd>A nice smell of paper with a touch of smoke, dropping quickly to an overwhelmingly smoky tone.</dd>

<dt>The Night Library, by SeventySevenScents</dt><dd>I got fresh soap with maybe an undertone of leather and vanilla, nice, but for floral lovers. Their "Smoke n' Leather" on the other hand, is both, up front and in your face (in a good way, if you like your leather and hellfire).</dd>

<dt><span class=edit id='20240318'>Old Books, by SmellsLikeBooks</span></dt><dd><span class=edit id='20240318'>Once it calms, probably the closest to smelling like a specific type of old book, and nice as a day-to-day scent. Perhaps makes you realise you're not after one type of book, but a Platonic old book. Combines so well into a single scent it is quite hard to work out what is going on: not-quite-soapy, woody, leathery, vanilla, with a slight citrus and sandalwood tinge? Wouldn't be out 
of place with Imperial Leather and Mothballs, but smells nicer than either.</span></dd>

<dt><span class=edit id='20240412'>Old Books, by Apothescary</span></dt><dd><span class=edit id='20240412'>Again, smells like old books, but perhaps with something else laid over the top, something sweet and leathery, like 
someone with cute bangs at an BDSM orgy.</span></dd>

<h2>Other favourites</h2>

<dt><a href="https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Geo-F-Trumper/Astor-Cologne-4996.html" target="_new">Astor</a>, by Geo. F. Trumper<span class=note>5</span></dt><dd>Old (1880), and smells like nothing else on the market. Caraway and petitgrain. Doesn't 
claim to be bookish, but has everything you'd expect of one of the above, combined with a clean, bathhouse kind of smell. I think I like it because in my head: Astor &gt; Cliveden &gt; Profumo &gt; decadence. 
But that's just me.</dd>

Notes:
</p>
<p>
<span class=note>1</span> For more on the smell of books see the <a href="https://www.compoundchem.com/2014/06/01/newoldbooksmell/"" target="_new">excellent infographic from Compound Interest</a>. Church smells 
are obviously more complex, dependant as they are on the incense burnt, the wood waxes used, the level of damp, and the local building materials. Given this, it is perhaps somewhat miraculous that so many smell similarly of 
old plaster and wet brick.   
</p>
<p>
<span class=note>2</span> The others in the range are sadly less convincing; I've yet to find a good Japanese temple scent, or even incense stick, though a good agarwood will come close.
</p>
<p>
<span class=note>3</span> I've also tried their "<a href="https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/The-Perfumer-s-Story-by-Azzi/Ditch-by-Jonas-Akerlund-40010.html" target="_new">Ditch</a>", and my, it really does make you smell like a foetid ditch; worth buying a sample just to try it. Settles down to something more bearable, but stays with you.
</p>
<p>
<span class=note>4</span> A lovely seller, with an interesting range of scents recreating a wide range of experiences.
</p>
<p>
<span class=note>5</span> Trumper have a number of unusual old scents, including their  
<a href="https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Geo-F-Trumper/Wild-Fern-Cologne-5011.html" target="_new">Wild Fern</a> (1877), which I have some fondness for.
