Notes:
</p>
<p>
<span class=note>1</span>In 2018 I had a six month breakdown that oscillated between days of screaming into the void and exhausted unconsciousness; after six months of living for the next breath I was a total void. I decided to 
rebuild from the ground up, and reread a lot of the books I read as a teenager, filtering out the unhelpful. Those above were my starting point, and thank the gods of literature for that.
